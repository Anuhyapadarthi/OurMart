An e-commerce grocery store website design.
What is there on the project? 

Here, I have made a basic eCommerce website with all the basic functionalities like, showing the services, login and signup for users, and it facilitated users for senting messages or issues they face.

Why did I choose to work on it? 

 I have learned frontend and some areas in backend. So, I decided to go on with the idea of helping people for their basic needs. And as I all know serious pandemic is going on thus people need something which can help them to buy basic stuff without going outside as per the Govt. norms. Thus, I locked on with the idea of making an eCommerce website which works efficiently. 

The technologies I have used to work on it. 

 I have used HTML,CSS as a front-end with Bootstrap for design purposes since it allows us to create responsive UI in less time. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, sections, buttons, navigation and other interface components. 

Issues I faced during the project? How did I overcome it? 

Very minor issues we have faced during the project as some components are new to us like icons in bootstrap. But, I work on those things and also thanks to CodeWithHarry's lecture videos. I went through it. Thus, I manage to overcome the problems.

Future Scope :

 In the future scope of this project, I can add a page where it shows products and takes the items and add it to cart.I can include authentication like mobile No. OTP login.
